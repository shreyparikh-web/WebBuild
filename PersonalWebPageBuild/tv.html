					<h2>My Favorite TV Shows</h2>

				<div class="left">
					<p>My favorite TV show of all time is Lucifer. Lucifer is about the Devil who gave up his throne to hell to become a civilian concultant for the Los Angeles Police Department. He also runs his own high end night club called "Lux". I like this TV show because it has the right amount of action and drama with a great plot. It also has just the right amount of fiction to make it seem intresting, but not too much so it is too unrealistic. I would definitely recomend this TV show. It is a 10/10 and I really enjoyed it.</p>

					<p>I watch a lot of movies, but my favorite one is Extraction. This movis is about a boy who is kidnapped by an bangaldeshi druglord. The boy is the son of a very important indian polition who hires Chirs Hemsworth a really good mercenary/hitman to bring the child back to his family. This movie is packed with action and huge plot twist through out the movie. The ending of the movie is quite unexpected. I would rate this movie a 10/10. It has a lot of action and is realistic. Also Chris Hemsworth's acting portrays the main character as so heartless, but over the movie he becomes more caring and grateful.</p>
