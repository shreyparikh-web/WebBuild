					<p>I have tried to do track every year since sixth grade, but there has always been something that prevented me from doing it. In sixth grade I was too young to participate and had to wait another year. In seventh my physical did not pass and I was not allowed to participate. In eighth my hand broke days before the season started. Due to safety reasons I could not participate. This year a virus stopped me from doing track. Although I could not participate I stilled trained to keep fit for the next year. I really hope I can participate in track sophmore year.</p>
					<p>My favorite sport to watch is football. I started watching it in fifth grade with my dad. My dad's favorite team was the patriots and his bias rubbed off on me. My favorite team is also the patriots. I am very excited to see how well the team will play this year without their star player, Tom Brady</p>
					<p>Other than football I like to play basketball wwith my friends. Last year during summer break I would go to a park near my house everyday and play with the kids in my neighborhood. We all had fun playing and once in a while we would go to Wawa, which was half a mile away. I am very sad that we all must stay inside and limit social interactions because I want to go out and meet my friends.</p>
					<p>Over the years I have tried to play many sports, but I only continued a few.</p>
