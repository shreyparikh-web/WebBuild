					<h2>My Favorite Foods</h2>

					<p>I like a lot of foods. My favorite meal type food is grilled cheese. When I eat grilled cheese I prefer them with no crust and melted cheese inside. I make grilled cheese differently from most people. I put the cheese on the pan first. Once the cheese melts I then add the bread on top of it. After the cheese becomes crusty I flip over the grilled cheese and let the bread cook. Once the bread is done I fold My grilled cheese in half. The reason I like my grilled cheese like this is because this lets the cheese harden a little making the sandwich more crunchy.</p>

					<p>I have a very sweet tooth. I like foods that are extremely sweet like icecream brownies and cookies. My favorite icecream flavor is cookiedough. One thing I really like doing is putting caramel on my icecream. This makes the icecream sweeter. My favorite place to get icecream from is Coldstone. This place makes amazing icecream and also has the best cones ever. If I could I would eat icecream everyday, but it is very unhealthy to do so.</p>
