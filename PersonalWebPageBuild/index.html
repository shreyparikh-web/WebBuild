					<p>Hello. My name is Shrey Parikh. I am 15 years old and going to tenth grade this year. I am excited to return back to school and see my friends again. My favorite part about school is meeting new people and making new friends. I have a younger brother and sister who I have been spending a lot time with because of quarentine. My brother is very playful and energetic. He is 9 years old and is going to fourth grade. My sister is 13 years old and going into eighth grade.</p>
